          This hostel is fantastic, with exceptional service and a welcoming atmosphere. The food is not only delicious but also well-balanced in portion sizes. 
          The rooms are spacious and filled with natural light, making it a great place for students. The environment is ideal for studying, and there are shops nearby for any extra needs. 
          Highly recommend this hostel for anyone looking for a quality stay. Definitely worth a visit!

  review: I had a lovely stay at Tejaswee last year while I was visiting Kathmandu. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. The rooms were spacious and clean, and I felt very safe during my stay. I would definitely recommend this hostel.
